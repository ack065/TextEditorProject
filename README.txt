This is a project based in ASP.NET combined with Bootstrap for stylizing.
The project is simple in nature and was used to further my knowledge with 
the MVC software development and design pattern
and to upgrade my frontend skillset with the Bootstrap framework.

Describing it, I can say that it has a system for uniquely identifying different users
and it functions for each user independently. Each of the documents are restricted to 
a single userID key, which means other users aren't able to remove/edit foreign documents.

It consists two controllers and contexts, one for the Home screen, and the otherone for the Documents 
that the users will manipulate.

For the text ediotr, I use an API from the TinyTextEditor (https://www.tiny.cloud/) and save everything
in a local database.


For the futre I plan on developing this project more, so that I may enable multi user participation,
other types of document executions (such as exel, powerpoint and similar), and the possibility 
to share the document, comment on it, branch version from it and other developments.

I also plan on furthering my knowlege with cloud-based systems, specifically Microsoft Azure and
incorporating that said sistem into a cloud based database.
